# COMP415_project3_sbelliveau
Given the time constraints I didn't get portions like guibuttons for user options at the end of the game so those are not included, I am submitting another project with the wasm files which are only working running the first portion of the game we worked on in class, for whatever reason it will not run my program no matter what I do. A big issue is golang being very laggy on my mahcine, on my end even running this program I have 96 error messages and 26 warning messages, many issues with wasm may have to do with the project orginally being the one given to us in class, it gives vcs mapping issues warnings
